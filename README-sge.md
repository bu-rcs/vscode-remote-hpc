# vscode-remote-hpc for SGE

A one-click script to setup and connect VS Code to a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) based HPC compute node, directly from the VS Code remote explorer.

## Features
This script is designed to be used with the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension for Visual Studio Code. 

- Automatically starts a batch job, or reuses an existing one, for VS Code to connect to.
- Just connect from the remote explorer and the script handles everything automatically through the ssh `ProxyCommand`.
- Support for arbitrary types of jobs using `qsub` options.

## Requirements
- `sshd` must be available on the compute node, installed in `/usr/sbin` or available in the PATH
- A typical `sshd` installation is required, it must read login keys from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` 
- You must be allowed to run `sshd` in a batch job on an arbitrary port above 10000, and connect to it from the login node
- The `nc` command (netcat) must be available on the HPC login node
- Compute node names must resolve to their internal IP addresses
- Compute nodes must be accessible via IP from the login node
- You must have SSH access to the HPC login node
- SGE must be properly configured on your HPC system

These requirements are usually met, except if explicitly changed or forbidden by your system admin.

## Setup

Git clone the repo on the HPC login node (replace `HPC-LOGIN` with your own) and run the installer. 

```shell
ssh HPC-LOGIN
git clone git@github.com:gmertes/vscode-remote-hpc.git
cd vscode-remote-hpc
bash install-sge.sh
```

The script will be installed in `~/bin` and added to your PATH. 

Open the installed script `~/bin/vscode-remote-sge` with your favourite editor and edit the `QSUB_PARAM_CPU` and `QSUB_PARAM_GPU` parameters at the top according to your SGE system. 

Common SGE resource directives:
- `-l h_rt=HH:MM:SS` - Hard time limit (wall clock time)
- `-l mem=XG` - Memory request (e.g., `32G`)
- `-l cpu=N` - Number of CPUs (e.g., `8`)
- `-l gpu=N` - Number of GPUs (if your SGE is configured for GPU support)
- `-pe pe_name N` - Parallel environment with N cores

Example configurations:

**For CPU jobs:**
```bash
QSUB_PARAM_CPU="-l h_rt=12:00:00,mem=32G,cpu=8"
```

**For GPU jobs:**
```bash
QSUB_PARAM_GPU="-l h_rt=04:00:00,mem=32G,cpu=8,gpu=1"
```

It is recommended to keep the job time (`-l h_rt=`) to a reasonable amount. The script expects that jobs get automatically killed when they reach their wall clock time. 

On your local machine, generate a new ssh key for vscode-remote:

```shell
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/vscode-remote-sge -t ed25519 -N ""
```

Copy the public key to your HPC `authorized_keys`, you can use `ssh-copy-id`:

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/vscode-remote-sge HPC-LOGIN
```

In VS Code, change the `remote.SSH.connectTimeout` setting. Set this to the maximum time in seconds you expect a new job to start on your HPC. The script default is `300`.

```yaml
"remote.SSH.connectTimeout": 300
```

Add the following entry to your local machine's `~/.ssh/config`. Change `USERNAME` and `HPC-LOGIN` accordingly:

```bash
Host vscode-remote-sge-cpu
    User USERNAME
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vscode-remote-sge
    ProxyCommand ssh HPC-LOGIN "~/bin/vscode-remote-sge cpu"
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

You can change `vscode-remote-sge cpu` to `vscode-remote-sge gpu` to start a GPU job.

## Usage
The `vscode-remote-sge-cpu` host is now available in the VS Code remote explorer. Connecting to this host will automatically launch a batch job on a CPU node, wait for it to start, and connect to the node when the job is running.

Running jobs are automatically reused. If a running job is already found, it will simply connect to it. You can safely open many remote windows and they will all share the same running job. 

Note that disconnecting the remote session in vscode will **not** kill the job on the HPC. You can close the remote window and the job will keep running. Jobs are expected to be automatically killed by the SGE scheduler when they reach their wall clock time. You can manually kill the job using `qdel` or with the `vscode-remote-sge cancel` command (see [CLI](#CLI)).

You can have one CPU and one GPU job running at the same time, just add a new entry in your `~/.ssh/config` for the GPU job:

```bash
Host vscode-remote-sge-gpu
    User USERNAME
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vscode-remote-sge
    ProxyCommand ssh HPC-LOGIN "~/bin/vscode-remote-sge gpu"
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

## CLI
The `vscode-remote-sge` command installed on your HPC offers some commands to list or cancel running jobs. Do `vscode-remote-sge help` for help on its usage.

```bash
$ vscode-remote-sge help
Usage :  ~/bin/vscode-remote-sge [command]

    General commands:
    list      List running vscode-remote jobs
    cancel    Cancels running vscode-remote jobs
    ssh       SSH into the node of a running job
    help      Display this message
```

## Troubleshooting

### Job stays in "qw" (queued waiting) state
This usually means SGE cannot allocate the resources you requested. Check:
- Do the resource types exist in your SGE configuration? (use `qconf -sc` to list complex attributes)
- Are there available nodes with those resources?
- Check with your system admin if your user has quota limits

### Cannot connect to compute node
- Ensure `sshd` is available on compute nodes
- Check that compute node hostnames resolve correctly: `getent hosts <nodename>`
- Verify compute nodes are accessible from the login node: `ssh <nodename>`

### Job submitted but vscode fails to connect
- Increase the `TIMEOUT` value in vscode-remote-sge if your cluster is slow to start jobs
- Check `sshd` logs on the compute node: `ps aux | grep sshd`
- Verify the port being used (10000-65000) is not blocked by firewall
